# Quartet

Quartet is an R package that calculates the Quartet distance between two trees:
a measure of their similarity based on the number of shared four-taxon subtrees.

The package uses the `tqDist` algorithm.  Unlike many other implementations,
it distinguishes between quartets that are contradicted by one tree,
and quartets that are simply absent due to a lack of resolution (i.e. the presence
of polytomies).  `Quartet` makes this distinction in both the quartet metric
(function `QuartetStatus`) and the partition metric (i.e. Robinson-Foulds distance;
function `SplitStatus`).


## Using the package
The package will soon be compiled and uploaded to the CRAN repository.  
Meanwhile, you can install the latest version of the package into R thus:

```r
# Install the devtools package from CRAN
install.packages('devtools')

# Install the package from github
devtools::install_github('ms609/Quartet', args='--no-multiarch')

# Load the package into R
library('Quartet')
```

You will need Rtools installed (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to allow R to build the package.
