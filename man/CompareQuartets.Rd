\title{Compare Quartet States}
\usage{
CompareQuartets(x, cf)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of quartet states, perhaps generated in
\code{\link{QuartetStates}}.}

\item{cf}{a second such list.}
}
\value{
Returns an array of six numeric elements, each corresponding to the quantities of Estabrook \emph{et al}. (1985):
\describe{
\item{N}{The total number of quartet \emph{statements} for two trees of \emph{n} tips,
i.e. 2 \emph{Q}.}
\item{Q}{The total number of quartets for \emph{n} tips.}
\item{s}{The number of quartets that are resolved identically in both trees.}
\item{d}{The number of quartets that are resolved differently in each tree.}
\item{r1}{The number of quartets that are resolved in tree 1, but not in tree 2.}
\item{r2}{The number of quartets that are resolved in tree 2, but not in tree 1.}
\item{u}{The number of quartets that are unresolved in both trees.}
}
}
\description{
Compares two lists of quartet states, detailing how many are identical and
how many are unresolved.  Uses explicit enumeration.  For most purposes,
the function \link{QuartetStatus} will be preferable.

\examples{
  n_tip <- 6
  trees <- list(ape::rtree(n_tip, tip.label=seq_len(n_tip), br=NULL),
                ape::rtree(n_tip, tip.label=seq_len(n_tip), br=NULL))
  splits <- lapply(trees, TreeSearch::Tree2Splits)
  quartets <- QuartetStates(splits)
  CompareQuartets(quartets[[1]], quartets[[2]])
