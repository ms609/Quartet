\usage{
CompareSplits(splits, splits2)

CompareBipartitions(splits, splits2)
}
\arguments{
\item{splits}{A two-dimensional matrix of logicals, with rows corresponding
to terminal taxa, and each column defining a split that divides taxa marked
\code{TRUE} from taxa marked \code{FALSE}.  Possibly generated using \link{Tree2Splits}.
The parity of each column is irrelevant.}

\item{splits2}{A matrix of bipartitions against which to compare \code{splits}.
If row names are present, then all rows present in \code{splits} must be present
in \code{splits2}.  If they are absent, then both matrices must have the same
number of rows, and tips will be assumed to be in the same sequence.}
}
\value{
A named vector of six integers, listing the number of unique splits that:

\strong{N}    exist in total; i.e. the number of splits in \code{splits1} plus the number in \code{splits2},
equivalent to 2 \emph{s} + \emph{d1} + \emph{d2} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2};

\strong{s}    occur in both \code{splits1} and \code{splits2};

\strong{d1}   occur in \code{splits1} but are contradicted by \code{splits2};

\strong{d2}   occur in \code{splits2} but are contradicted by \code{splits1};

\strong{r1}   occur in \code{splits1} only, being neither present in nor contradicted by \code{splits2};

\strong{r2}   occur in \code{splits2} only, being neither present in nor contradicted by \code{splits1};

\strong{RF}   the number of splits that occur in one tree only; i.e. \emph{d1} + \emph{d2} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2},
the Robinson-Foulds distance.
