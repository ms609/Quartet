\description{
'\href{https://ms609.github.io/Quartet/}{Quartet}' is an R package that calculates
the Quartet distance between two trees: a measure of their similarity based
on the number of shared four-taxon subtrees.
}
\details{
The package uses the \code{tqDist} algorithm.  Unlike many other implementations,
it distinguishes between quartets that are contradicted by one tree,
and quartets that are simply absent due to a lack of resolution (i.e. the presence
of polytomies).  'Quartet' makes this distinction in both the quartet metric
(function \code{\link[=QuartetStatus]{QuartetStatus()}}) and the partition metric (i.e. Robinson-Foulds
distance; function \code{\link[=SplitStatus]{SplitStatus()}}).
\subsection{Known limitations}{

Quartet supports trees with up to 477 leaves.  Larger trees contain more
quartets than can be represented by R's signed 32-bit integers.

The underlying 'tqDist' library may handle trees with up to 568 leaves,
and 64-bit integer representations could increase this number further.
Making either of these imporvements within the R package
would require substantial additional work, but could be implemented -- do
\href{https://ms609.github.io/Quartet/issues}{file an issue} if this would be
useful to you.
