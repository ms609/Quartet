\description{
'\href{https://ms609.github.io/Quartet/}{Quartet}' is an R package that calculates
the quartet distance between two trees (Estabrook \emph{et al.} 1985),
a measure of their similarity based on the number of shared four-taxon subtrees.
}
\details{
The quartet distance outperforms a number of widely used tree distances
(e.g. the Robinson–Foulds, path, and rearrangement distances) against a number
theoretical and practical measures (Steel & Penny 1993; Smith 2020),
and is particularly valuable in the construction of tree spaces (Smith 2021).

'Quartet' uses the 'tqDist' algorithm (Brodal \emph{et al.} 2004; Sand \emph{et al.} 2014).
Unlike many other implementations, it distinguishes between quartets that are
contradicted by one tree,
and quartets that are simply absent due to a lack of resolution (i.e.
the presence of polytomies; see Smith 2019).
'Quartet' makes this distinction in both the quartet metric (function
\code{QuartetStatus()}) and the partition metric (i.e. Robinson-Foulds distance;
function \code{SplitStatus()}).
\subsection{Using Quartet}{

View the \href{https://ms609.github.io/Quartet/reference/}{function reference}
and \href{https://ms609.github.io/Quartet/articles/Using-Quartet.html}{basic usage instructions}.
}

\subsection{Known limitations}{

Quartet supports trees with up to 477 leaves.  Larger trees contain more
quartets than can be represented by R's signed 32-bit integers.

The underlying 'tqDist' library may handle trees with up to 568 leaves,
and 64-bit integer representations could increase this number further.
Making either of these improvements within the R package
would require substantial additional work, but could be implemented -- do
\href{https://github.com/ms609/Quartet/issues/new/}{file an issue} if this would
be useful to you.
