\arguments{
\item{elementStatus}{Two-dimensional integer array, with rows corresponding to
counts of matching quartets or partitions for each tree, and columns named
according to the output of \link{QuartetStatus} or \link{SplitStatus}.}

\item{similarity}{Logical specifying whether to calculate the similarity
or dissimilarity.}
}
\value{
\code{SimilarityMetrics} returns a named two-dimensional array in which each row
corresponds to an input tree, and each column corresponds to one of the
listed measures.

\code{DoNotConflict} and equivalents return a named vector describing the requested
similarity (or difference) between the trees.

\description{
Functions to calculate tree similarity / difference metrics.

\details{
Estabrook \emph{et al.} (1985, table 2) define four similarity metrics in terms of the
total number of quartets (\emph{Q}), the number of quartets resolved in the same
manner in two trees (\emph{s}), the number resolved differently in both trees
(\emph{d}), the number resolved in tree 1 or 2 but unresolved in the other tree
(\emph{r1}, \emph{r2}), and the number that are unresolved in both trees (\emph{u}).

The similarity metrics are then given as below.  The dissimilarity metrics
are their complement (i.e. 1 - \emph{similarity}), and can be calculated
algebraically using the identity \emph{Q} = \emph{s} + \emph{d} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2} + \emph{u}.
\itemize{
\item Do Not Conflict (DC): 1 - (\emph{d} / \emph{Q})
\item Explicitly Agree (EA): \emph{s} / \emph{Q}
\item Strict Joint Assertions (SJA): \emph{s} / (\emph{s} + \emph{d})
\item SemiStrict Joint Assertions (SSJA): \emph{s} / (\emph{s} + \emph{d} + \emph{u})
}

(The numerator of the Semistrict Joint Assertions similarity metric is given in
Estabrook \emph{et al}. (1985)'s table 2 as \emph{s} + \emph{d}, but this is interpreted, with
reference to their text, as a typographic error.)

Steel & Penny (1993) propose a further metric, which they denote dQ,
which this package calculates using the function \code{SteelPenny}:
\itemize{
\item Steel & Penny's Quartet Metric (dQ): (\emph{s} + \emph{u}) / \emph{Q}
}

Although defined using quartets, analagous values can be calculated using
partitions by replacing \emph{s} and \emph{d} with 2_s_ and (\emph{d1} + \emph{d2}),
and \emph{Q} with \emph{N}.
Note that, for reasons listed elsewhere (see Smith 2019, supplementary text),
quartets offer a more meaningful measure of the amount of information
shared by two trees.

Another take on tree similarity is to consider the symmetric difference: that is,
the number of quartets or partitions present in one tree that do not appear in the
other, originally used to measure tree similarity by Robinson & Foulds (1981).
\itemize{
\item Robinson Foulds (RF): \emph{d1} + \emph{d2} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2}
}

With quartets, \emph{d1} + \emph{d2} = 2 \emph{d}.

(Note that, given the familiarity of the Robinson Foulds distance metric, this
quantity is by default expressed as a difference rather than a similarity.)

To contextualize the symmetric difference, it may be normalized against:
\itemize{
\item The total number of resolved quartets or partitions present in both trees (Day 1986):
\itemize{
\item Day's Symmetric Difference (SD): (\emph{d1} + \emph{d2} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2}) /
(\emph{d1} + \emph{d2} + 2 \emph{s} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2})
}
\item The total distinctly resolved quartets or partitions (Day 1986):
\itemize{
\item Marczewski-Steinhaus (MS): (\emph{d1} + \emph{d2} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2}) /
(\emph{d1} + \emph{d2} + \emph{s} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2})
}
\item The maximum number of quartets or partitions that could have been resolved, given the
number of tips (Smith 2019):
\itemize{
\item Quartet Divergence: (\emph{d1} + \emph{d2} + \emph{r1} + \emph{r2}) / 2 \emph{Q}
}
}

The partition equivalent to the latter will depend on the question being
asked, as Q should denote the maximum difference that \emph{could} have been
obtained.
