#' Quartet
#' 
#' '[Quartet](https://ms609.github.io/Quartet/)' is an R package that calculates
#'  the Quartet distance between two trees: a measure of their similarity based
#'  on the number of shared four-taxon subtrees.
#' 
#' The package uses the `tqDist` algorithm.  Unlike many other implementations,
#' it distinguishes between quartets that are contradicted by one tree,
#' and quartets that are simply absent due to a lack of resolution (i.e. the presence
#' of polytomies).  'Quartet' makes this distinction in both the quartet metric
#' (function [`QuartetStatus()`]) and the partition metric (i.e. Robinson-Foulds
#'  distance; function [`SplitStatus()`]).
#' 
#' ## Known limitations
#' 
#' Quartet supports trees with up to 477 leaves.  Larger trees contain more 
#' quartets than can be represented by R's signed 32-bit integers.
#' 
#' The underlying 'tqDist' library may handle trees with up to 568 leaves,
#' and 64-bit integer representations could increase this number further.  
#' Making either of these imporvements within the R package 
#' would require substantial additional work, but could be implemented -- do
#' [file an issue](https://ms609.github.io/Quartet/issues) if this would be
#' useful to you.
